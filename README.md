- 👋 Hi, I’m @TanishaEileen
- 👀 I’m interested in web development and programming in general. Its a great outlet for my creative ideas.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Javascript and Web Development. I am fairly comfortable now with HTML and CSS as I work on 
publishing my first website that i've coded myself. 

- 💞️ I’m not sure what i'm looking to collaborate on. I'm just working on building my skills and my current projects. 

- If you wanna reach me you can email me at tanisha@tanishaeileen.com
